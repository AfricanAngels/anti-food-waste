# FoodshareProject

We’ve been told there’s not enough food to go around. But we really do have enough food to feed everyone on the planet. The problem is getting it to people who need it. 
In this project, we are trying to connect excess food with hungry mouth.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.4.
